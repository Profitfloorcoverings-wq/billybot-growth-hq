## Cold email v1 (short)
**Subject:** Quick idea for {business_name}

Hi {first_name},

I’m building BillyBot for flooring companies — it turns enquiries into accurate quotes fast (using your pricing rules), and follows up so fewer leads go cold.

If I record a 60‑sec walkthrough tailored to {business_name}, would you like to see it?

## Cold email v2 (problem/solution)
**Subject:** Missed flooring enquiries → missed jobs

Hi {first_name},

Most flooring enquiries land while you’re on-site — slow reply usually means they book someone else.

BillyBot replies instantly, captures room sizes/material/timeframe/postcode, and books a callback.

Open to a quick 10‑min call to see if it’s worth piloting for {business_name}?

## Follow-up 1 (2–4 days)
**Subject:** Re: {business_name}

Quick bump — want me to send a 60‑sec demo tailored to {business_name}, or who’s best to speak to?

– Steve

## Follow-up 2 (7–10 days)
**Subject:** Close the loop?

No worries if it’s not a priority. Reply “demo” and I’ll send a 60‑sec walkthrough, or “call” and I’ll send times.

– Steve
